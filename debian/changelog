nautilus-wipe (0.1.1+git20130516-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream Git snapshot at commit 24433cb. (Closes: #699080)
  * Invoke dh_install with --fail-missing.
  * Drop dependency on GConf 2.x: it's only useful for Nautilus 2.x.
  * Don't configure --with-gtk3: upstream made it the default.
  * Use upstream Git tags instead of tarballs as their canonical releases:
    - Don't use dh-autoreconf: we don't import autogenerated
      upstream files anymore.
    - Run autogen.sh before attempting to configure.
      Accordingly add build-depend on libtool.
    - Use xz compression.

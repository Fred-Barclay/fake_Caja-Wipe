Generic Instructions:
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install

If you have both GTK2 and GTK3 development files installed and want to
build against GTK2, you should pass the ``--without-gtk3`` flag to
``./configure``.

If you are building from Git, you first need to run ``./autogen.sh``,
which will prepare the build system and generate the `configure` script.
